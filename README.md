A COVID-19 dashboard in Tableau with 10 plots which I have created to answer certain questions/ concerns regarding the status of COVID-19 can be used to monitor and understand the impact of the pandemic. The dashboard provides a visual representation of key metrics related to the pandemic, which can help identify trends, hotspots, and areas of concern. Some of the specific use cases for the dashboard are:

Public health monitoring: Public health officials can use the dashboard to monitor the spread of the virus, identify areas of high transmission, and allocate resources accordingly.

Policy decisions: Government officials can use the dashboard to inform policy decisions related to reopening, restrictions, and vaccination efforts.

Business planning: Businesses can use the dashboard to monitor the impact of the pandemic on their operations, assess the risk of outbreaks in different locations, and plan for contingencies.

Community awareness: The dashboard can be made publicly available to help increase awareness and understanding of the pandemic in the community.

Overall, the dashboard can be a valuable tool for understanding and responding to the pandemic and can help inform decision-making at the local, regional, and national levels.
